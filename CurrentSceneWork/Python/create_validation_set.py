Write code that takes the labeled data and outputs a training dataset in `Data/Lab2/Train/`
and a validation dataset in `Data/Lab2/Validation`. These datasets should contain CSV files
that have their corresponding activity in their filename (similar to the the `Labeled/` folder).
No file should appear in both the training and validation sets.
Be sure to include documentation with clear instructions on how to run the script and expected outputs.
