PLEASE READ:

The "python" folder in here has the old python script we used for our project.

The "python_working_updated" has the updated scripts for our project that ensure it works as intended.

In order to run this project, please first run the "flaskserverstuff.py" file from the python_working_updated folder with
the following command: "python flaskserverstuff.py". Afterward, start the unity project. 
Once this unity project is built and running, you should be able to send data and receive
stress level classifications.

This framework was entirely made by Quinn Thompson.
